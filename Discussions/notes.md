# Edward Tufte's Multi-functioning Graph Elements

## Intro

Today I will be talking about the concept of mutli-functioning graph elements. As the name implies the concept is simply about conveying multiple pieces of information in a single graph element. 

A good way of thinking about it is as a logical extension of the data-to-ink ratio. If you remember the whole idea of the data-to-ink ratio is to maximize the amount of information you can convey with the least amount of ink.

“Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data.”
Tufte(1983), pg. 139

Essentially you're creatively repurposing something that conveys information in one way like a dot on a line or a color on a map and manipulating it in a way such that it can convey multiple pieces of information. A dot can be a certain size or shape which conveys additional information.

## Examples

A classic example of using multi-functioning graph elements is the stem & leaf graph where you present quantitative information in the form of a histogram. The values are displayed in buckets depending on the scale for the data.

For example 19 bar 3 is equivalent to a single data point meaning a volcano that is 19,300 feet tall.

These graphs are not without their flaws though. They generally only work with smaller data sets due to the meaningfullness of the specific data values losing value as the data set grows

In addition, in my opinion you need prior knowledge or an explanation to understand the layout the data. For this plot type I think it is a fair trade-off but is certainly something to consider when working with multi-functioning graph elements in general

This leads into another common example from Tufte. Its a map of midwest and canada overlaid with a territory grid. The grid lines are distorted to show inaccuracies in the original map of the area.

Here you are using grid lines in two ways on the same graphic to convey two novel but related stories. 

Again I feel there are some flaws with this example. It takes significant information to convey the meaning of the distortion of the map. Also with the distortion the actual grid information more difficult to understand to the point that they include the un-distorted modern map in the bottom right corner.

Here is an example from fivethirtyeight.com where they actually have a pretty good multi-functioning visual element but don't leverage it. In the partisan lean column they use the color commonly associated with the two major parties to color a number which conveys the numerical value of the lean. Where they violate the ratio is that they also add a R or D to the number to convey the party.ß
